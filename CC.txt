1. I like using "real" documentation because the way you input the coordinates,
   colors, and widths. I struggle with some of the syntax.

2. GUI canvas is different from an image because there are interactive objects in 
   a GUI canvas, whereas an image is not interactive. You can add buttons, sliders,
   and many more options into a GUI, while an image is just a static set of pixels.
